# Neural Network Avalanche Game

An interactive educational platform where you can design, optimize, and test artificial neural networks (ANNs) to solve complex challenges on the Avalanche blockchain.

## Features

- **Interactive Neural Network Builder**: Design your own neural network architecture with customizable layers, neurons, and connections
- **3D Network Visualization**: See your neural network come to life in an interactive 3D visualization
- **Training Simulator**: Train your network on various datasets and see real-time performance metrics
- **Blockchain Integration**: Store your scores and neural network configurations on the Avalanche blockchain
- **Leaderboard**: Compete with other players and see who can create the most efficient neural networks
- **Achievement Badges**: Earn NFT badges for completing challenges

## Game Levels

1. **RGB Color Classifier**: Build a neural network that can classify colors based on their RGB values as "warm" or "cool"
2. **Pattern Recognition Challenge**: Create an optimized neural network that can identify complex patterns in multi-dimensional data
3. **Efficiency Challenge**: Design the smallest possible neural network that still achieves high accuracy

## Technical Details

- Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- 3D visualizations using Three.js and React Three Fiber
- Smart contracts on Avalanche blockchain for storing scores and network configurations
- Web3 integration for wallet connection and blockchain interactions

## Getting Started

1. Connect your wallet using the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right
2. Start with Level 1 and build your first neural network
3. Train your network to achieve the target accuracy
4. Submit your score to the blockchain and advance to the next level

## Smart Contract

The game uses a smart contract deployed on the Avalanche Fuji testnet to store:

- Player scores and rankings
- Neural network configurations
- Achievement badges (as on-chain records)

## Development

To run the project locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
